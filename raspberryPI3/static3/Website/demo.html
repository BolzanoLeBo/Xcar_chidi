                At the <span class="strong">X-Car Project</span>, our mission is to make life more accessible for visitors and students at INSA who face mobility challenges or need assistance with heavy items on campus.
                Our core mission is simple: providing <span class="strong">transparent</span>  and  <span class="strong">safe transportation </span>support.
                Therefore, we made a car that can <span class="strong">follow a user</span> and that <span class="strong">explains</span> each decision it makes.

                X-CAR is a small car in the one a lot of electronic devices have been added. We can find the following equipment:
                <ul>

                    <li>6 <span class="strong" style="color: #007400;">Ultrasonic</span> sensors: 3 at the rear and 3 at the back of the car</li>
                    <li>A <span class="strong" style="color: #2587ea;">Lidar</span> in the back</li>
                    <li>A <span class="strong" style="color: #da5b00;">Camera</span> just next to the Lidar</li>
                    <li>2 <span class="strong" style="color: #ff9393;">STM32</span> Bords, a <span class="strong" style="color: #24b66d;">RasberryPi</span> and a <span class="strong" style="color: #ff58ff;">JetsonNano</span> to process all the different values from the sensors</li>

                        This mode allows the user to control the car using the joystick from the web interface.

                            In this safety mode, the interface indicates the reason, such as obstacle detection in this demonstration.
                            The vehicle is no longer able to move in the direction of the obstacle within the detection distance.

                            To track only the user, an initialization is required.
                            This is done by taking a photo by pressing the init button on the interface.

                            Once initialized, tracking can begin. The car then follows the user at a distance of approximately 1.70m.
                            <br> If the user wants to stop the car due to incorrect behavior, the emergency stop button on the interface can be used to halt the vehicle.

                            Thanks to the initialization, the car is able to recognize the user and therefore only follows them.
